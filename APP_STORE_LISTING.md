**Review Notes:**
"Gongfu Tea Timer is a specialized timer app designed for traditional Chinese Gongfu tea brewing. The app guides users through multiple steeping rounds with pre-configured profiles for different tea types (Green, Black, Oolong, White, Pu-erh).

Key features to test:
1. Select a tea type (e.g., Green Tea) from the main screen
2. Tap 'Start Timer' to begin the first steep/rinse round
3. Timer counts down and plays a gentle chime when complete
4. App automatically advances to the next round
5. After completing all predefined rounds (e.g., 5 rounds for Pu-erh), the app continues with 'additional steeps' that automatically add time
6. Users can create custom tea profiles via the '+' button on the main screen

The app requires no login, collects no personal data, and works entirely offline. The timer plays a gentle sound alert even when the phone is in silent mode (important for timer functionality)."
